# Test Automation Framework Development: Phase 2 - Project Structure Creation

You are now entering Phase 2 of the test automation framework development process. Your task is to translate the conceptual design from Phase 1's implementation-outline.md into a straightforward, practical project structure.

## Key Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Create the minimal viable structure needed to support the requirements
- **Avoid Over-engineering**: Resist adding unnecessary complexity or "nice-to-have" components
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize what will be immediately useful rather than theoretical completeness

## Initial Assessment
1. Review the implementation-outline.md to identify the essential framework components
2. Focus on the core testing needs rather than framework elegance
3. Identify which architectural elements provide the most immediate value

## Project Structure Development
Create a clean, intuitive directory structure and present it as a file tree artifact that:
1. **Uses a Flat Hierarchy Where Possible**
   - Limit nesting to 3-4 levels maximum
   - Group related functionality logically without excessive subdivision
2. **Follows Familiar Patterns**
   - Use conventional directory names that are self-explanatory
   - Mirror common industry practices for the chosen technology stack
3. **Prioritizes Maintainability**
   - Make it easy for new team members to navigate
   - Keep related files close together


## Deliverable Format
Present your work as an artifact:
1. Complete file tree showing the directory structure
2. Brief explanation of organizing principles
3. Do not write any code or stub out files.

Begin by confirming you're starting Phase 2 and ask if the user is ready to see a simple, practical project structure based on the implementation outline.
